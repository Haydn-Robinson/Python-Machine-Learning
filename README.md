A machine learning libary developed for educational purposes.

This library currently implements multilayer perceptron neural networks, as well as functionality to perform:
- Data pre-processing
- Hyperparameter search and cross-validation
- Model evaluation
- Data visualisation tasks.

The multilayer perceptron model implemented by the library is capable of handling regression, binary classification and multi-class classification problems.
However the suite of supporting functions (e.g. model evaluation functions) currently best supports binary classification problems (although basic support
for multiclass and regression problems is implemented, but not fully developed).
